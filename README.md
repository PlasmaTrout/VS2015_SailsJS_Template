# Visual Studio 2015 SailsJS Template

This is the Visual Studio 2015 project I used for a Node/Sails template so I could take full advantage
of Visual Studio's intellisense and features. In order to use it from GitHub you mush first pull it, then 
update the npm directory. Afterwards it should run with a simple F5.
